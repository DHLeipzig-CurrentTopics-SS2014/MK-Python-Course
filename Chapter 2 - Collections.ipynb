To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so `A` shifted by 3 is `D` and `Z` shifted by 1 is `A`. Define a string called `rotate_word` and an integer variable called `amount`. Now write a Python script that contains the letters from the `rotate_word`, but \"rotated\" by the given `amount`. Check your code using the following examples: 'cheer' rotated by 7 is 'jolly' and 'melon' rotated by -10 is 'cubed'.
