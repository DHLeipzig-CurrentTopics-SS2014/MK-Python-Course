## Opening the Interactive Notebooks

To open the interactive notebooks locally:

On Mac and Linux:
 - open a terminal
 - go to the directory where you downloaded and extracted our files (example: cd /your/path/to/python-course)
 - Run: ipython3 notebook

On Windows with Pyzo (assuming default installation):
 - open the command prompt
 - go to the directory where you downloaded and extracted our files (example: cd c:\your\path\to\python-course)
 - Run: c:\pyzo2013b\ipython.exe notebook

 Make sure not to use Internet Explorer, if that is your default browser. Instead, copy the URL that pops up into the address bar of a browser window in Google Chrome or Firefox.
